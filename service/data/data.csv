Everest Puffer Jacket,"This jacket is incredibly warm and lightweight! Perfect for cold winter mornings. The hood is a great addition, and it packs down surprisingly small. Highly recommend for anyone needing serious warmth.",Positive
Urban Commuter Raincoat,"Disappointed with this raincoat. It claims to be waterproof, but after walking in moderate rain for 15 minutes, my shirt was damp. The zipper also feels flimsy and gets stuck often. Not worth the price.",Negative
Summit Trekker Fleece,"A decent fleece jacket for the price. It's soft and provides good layering warmth for hiking. The pockets are a nice size. It's not the most stylish, but it gets the job done for outdoor activities.",Neutral
Classic Denim Jacket,"Absolutely love this classic denim jacket! The fit is perfect, not too tight or too baggy. It's become my go-to for casual outings and adds a cool touch to any outfit. The denim feels durable and soft after a few washes.",Positive
Voyager Windbreaker,"This windbreaker is okay, but not amazing. It blocks wind effectively, but the breathability isn't great, so I tend to get sweaty quickly during active use. The sizing also runs a bit small, so consider sizing up.",Neutral
